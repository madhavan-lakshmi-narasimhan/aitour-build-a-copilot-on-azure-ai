# Build a Retail Copilot Code-First on Azure AI

Use Azure AI Studio to build, evaluate, and deploy a customer support chat app. This custom copilot uses a RAG architecture built with Azure AI Search, Azure CosmosDB and Azure OpenAI to return responses grounded in the product and customer data.

## Session Description

In this sample we build, evaluate and deploy a customer support chat AI for Contoso Outdoors, a fictitious retailer who sells hiking and camping equipment. The implementation uses a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to implement a retail copilot solution that responds to customer queries with answers grounded in the company's product catalog and customer purchase history. The sample usesÂ Azure AI SearchÂ to create and manage search indexes for product catalog data,Â Azure Cosmos DBÂ to store and manage customer purchase history data, andÂ Azure OpenAIÂ to deploy and manage the core models required for our RAG-based architecture.
By exploring and deploying this sample, you will learn to: Build a retail copilot application using theÂ RAG pattern, define and engineer prompts using theÂ PromptyÂ asset, design, run & evaluate a copilot using theÂ PromptflowÂ framework, provision and deploy the solution to Azure using theÂ Azure Developer CLI, understand and apply Responsible AI practices likeÂ evaluation and content safety.

## Learning Outcomes

* Use Azure AI Studio as a code-first platform for building custom copilotsâ€‹

* Prototype custom copilot on VS Code with powerful tools (Prompty, Promptflow, Codespaces)â€‹

* Optimize your custom copilot with manual testing & AI-assisted evaluation (Quality, Safety)â€‹

* Operationalize your custom copilot by deploying to Azure AI Studio (Monitoring, Filters, Logs)â€‹

* Customize the sample to suit your application scenario (data, functions, frameworks, models)

## Technology Used

* Github Codespaces
* Azure AI Studio
* Azure AI Search
* Cosmos DB
* OpenAI GPT models
