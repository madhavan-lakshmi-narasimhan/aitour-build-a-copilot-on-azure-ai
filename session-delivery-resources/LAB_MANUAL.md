# Welcome to the AI Tour and workshop WRK550!

In this session, you will learn how to build, evaluate, and deploy, Contoso Chat - a custom RAG-based retail copilot built code-first on Azure AI.

The lab manual for this workshop is available in the code repo. For convenience you can visit a hosted preview version [here](https://aka.ms/aitour/contoso-chat/workshop). to walk through the steps. The end-to-end developer workflow has these steps:

| Section | Description |
|:---|:---| 
| [Pre-Requisites](https://nitya.github.io/contoso-chat/00-Before-You-Begin/) | Before you begin, make sure you meet the requirements for this lab. |
| [Provision](https://nitya.github.io/contoso-chat/01-Tour-Guide-Setup/01-setup/) | Launch the lab, Fork the Repo, Setup GitHub Codespaces to begin. |
| [Setup](https://nitya.github.io/contoso-chat/01-Tour-Guide-Setup/02-validate/) | Complete the pre-deployment steps (for infrastructure) and validate the development environment (on GitHub Codespaces) |
| [Explore Infra](https://nitya.github.io/contoso-chat/03-Workshop-Build/03-infra/)| Understand how the application architecture is provisioned, and how this connects to the RAG design pattern for our custom copilot |
| [Ideate: with Prompty](https://nitya.github.io/contoso-chat/03-Workshop-Build/04-ideation/) | Learn to build an initial prototype and iterate on it rapidly using prompt engineering techniques and Prompty tooling |
| [Evaluate: With AI](https://nitya.github.io/contoso-chat/03-Workshop-Build/05-evaluation/) | Learn to evaluate the copilot responses for core quality metrics using AI-assisted evaluation with custom evaluators - and observability with tracing |
| [Deploy: Endpoint & Testing](https://nitya.github.io/contoso-chat/03-Workshop-Build/06-operationalization/) | Understand how the prototype is packaged and deployed to a hosted endpoint on Azure. Learn to test this iteratively (local) and in production (hosted). |
| [Wrap-up: Cleanup](https://nitya.github.io/contoso-chat/04-Workshop-Wrapup/07-cleanup/) | Make sure you release lab resources and stop your GitHub Codespaces environment to conserve quota. Explore resources to continue learning. |
